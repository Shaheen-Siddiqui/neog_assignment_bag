        <!-- <br> -->
        Every Moment is Fresh Beginning

        Nowadays modern era we can see everything becoming digital and technology becoming day by day more creative and
        it helps the new generation. Javascript is one of the programing language where we can create plenty of web
        pages, mobile apps.

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem">What is JavaScript?
        </h2><br><br>
        JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to
        make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages,
        JavaScript gives web pages interactive element s that engage a user. JavaScript is used to program logic for the
        page layout. For example, HTML is like a car,CSS is like a car design, paint, and decoration, etc and JavaScript
        is like a car engine (interior logic).
        <h2>why Javascript is Important? :
        </h2><br><br>
        js makes responsive design easier. JavaScript has become integral to the Internet experience as developers build
        increased interaction and complexity into their applications. Search engines, e-commerce, content management
        systems, responsive design, social media, and phone apps would not be possible without it.

        As a client-side programming language, JavaScripthelps web developers to make web pages more dynamic and
        interactive
        by implementing custom client-side script.

        Web developers can't create Modern Applications withoutJavaScript Because:
        <h3>1.Implement client-side scripts

        </h3><br><br>
        It is originally designed as a client-side script language. The web developer can easily write and custom
        client-side scripts in JavaScripts and integrate the script seamlessly into HTML.

        <h3>2. Write Server-Side Code

        </h3><br><br>
        The web developer can also write the server-side code in JavaScript by using a cross-platform runtime engine
        like
        node.js.<br><br>
        <strong>There are also a number of reasons why each modern web developer must know how to leverage all benefits
            of
            JavaScript. i.e They can even combine JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 to create web pages that look good across
            browsers, platforms, and devices.</strong><br><br>
        We connect the HTML5 file with JavaScript using script tag and CSS3 with link tag in HTML.
        script tag : The "script" tag is used to embed a client-side script (JavaScript). The "script" element either
        contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.Common uses for
        JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

        <h2>3.Simplify Complex Web Application Development

        </h2><br><br>
        Despite being an interpreted programming language, JavaScript simplifies the development of complex web
        applications
        by allowing developers to simplify the applicationâ€™s composition. The programmers can use JavaScript libraries
        to
        create shadow DOM boundaries.<br><br><br><br>
